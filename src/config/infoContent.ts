          'needed — and is often ignored or worked around.\n\n' +
          'Selling OPTIONS is different. Instead of picking one answer ' +
          'up front, the architect identifies decisions that can be ' +

        'numbered, immutable, and append-only. You do not edit an old ADR ' +
        'when circumstances change; you write a new one that supersedes it.\n\n' +

          'to heavyweight architecture documents that nobody reads and nobody ' +
          'keeps up to date. The key insights:\n\n' +
          '1. Immutability. An accepted ADR is never edited. If you change ' +
          'your mind, write a new ADR with status "supersedes ADR-0012" and ' +
          'mark the old one "superseded by ADR-0037". The history of your ' +
          'thinking is preserved.\n\n' +
          '2. Consequences matter more than the decision. The "easier / ' +
          'harder / riskier" section is what future readers actually need. ' +
          'Writing it forces you to acknowledge trade-offs instead of ' +
          'pretending you picked a silver bullet.\n\n' +
          '3. Granularity. One ADR = one decision. "We use PostgreSQL" is ' +
          'one ADR. "We use PostgreSQL AND Redis AND Kafka" is three ADRs. ' +
          'Small ADRs are easier to read, easier to supersede, and easier ' +
          'to search for later.\n\n' +
          '4. Who writes them? Anyone making the decision — architect, tech ' +
          'lead, or the team itself. ADRs work best when they are a ' +
          '*working document*, written during the decision meeting, not a ' +
          'retrospective artefact filled in a week later.\n\n' +
          'ADRs pair naturally with "You build it, you run it": the team ' +
          'that owns the system also owns the record of why it is the way it ' +
          'is, and is on the hook when those consequences show up.',
