          'Riding the elevator means actively translating context. When you go up, ' +

        'carry the pager when it breaks at 3 a.m.\n\n' +

        'ADVANTAGES FOR THE DEV TEAM\n' +
        '  \u2022 Fast feedback: production behaviour reaches the authors directly, ' +

        '  \u2022 Better design: when *you* get paged, you stop shipping code ' +

        '  \u2022 Autonomy: no tickets to another team, no hand-off delays. ' +
        'The team decides how to deploy and can ship small changes often.\n' +
        '  \u2022 Clear ownership: one team is accountable for outcomes, not just ' +
        'outputs. Pride of craftsmanship returns.\n' +
