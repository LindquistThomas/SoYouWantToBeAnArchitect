/**
 * Regression: pressing Interact (Enter) / ToggleInfo (Up) while the player
 * is walking would previously leave the player sliding and the walk
 * animation looping for ~170ms while the info dialog was visible, because
 * the ground-deceleration path multiplies vx by 0.8 per frame.
 *
 * After the fix, `Player.update()` hard-snaps vx to 0 and switches to
 * `player_idle` as soon as the active input context is not `gameplay`
 * (i.e. a modal or menu is overlaying the scene).
