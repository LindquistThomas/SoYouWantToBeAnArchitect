# Skill: Git Worktree for Local Branches

## Why

The primary checkout at `C:\code\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect` keeps `main`'s `node_modules`, `dist/`, `playwright-report/`, and `test-results/` intact. Running `git checkout -b` in place blows those away (or at least invalidates Vite/Playwright caches) and breaks any concurrent agent session. Worktrees sidestep that.

## Convention

- Sibling directory: `C:\code\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect-<slug>`.
- Branch name: `<type>/<slug>` with `<type>` ∈ { `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `docs`, … } and `<slug>` in kebab-case.

## Create

```powershell
# From the primary checkout, on main
git worktree add ..\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect-<slug> -b <type>/<slug>
cd ..\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect-<slug>
npm install    # each worktree has its own node_modules
# …edit, build (npm run build), test (npm run test:all), commit…
```

## Integrate back into main

Ask the user whether to **rebase** or **merge**, then from the primary checkout:

```powershell
cd ..\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect
git fetch origin

# Rebase path (linear history):
git -C ..\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect-<slug> rebase origin/main
git merge --ff-only <type>/<slug>

# Or merge path (preserve branch topology):
git merge --no-ff <type>/<slug>
```

## Clean up

```powershell
git worktree remove ..\SoYouWantToBeAnArchitect-<slug>
git branch -d <type>/<slug>
```

## Rules

- Never force-remove a worktree with uncommitted changes without confirming with the user first.
- Don't symlink `node_modules` across worktrees — Vite and Playwright caches can collide.
- `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` are per-worktree; don't copy them back into `main`.
- If the user explicitly asks to work on the primary checkout (no worktree), honour that.
